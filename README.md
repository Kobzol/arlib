# k-Shortest Paths with limited Overlap

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

The code was used in the following publications (please cite):

- Theodoros Chondrogiannis, Panagiotis Bouros, Johann Gamper and Ulf Leser,
Exact and Approximate Algorithms for Finding k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap ,
In Proc. of the 20th Int. Conf. on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) (2017) 

- Theodoros Chondrogiannis, Panagiotis Bouros, Johann Gamper and Ulf Leser,
Alternative Routing: k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap ,
In Proc. of the 23rd ACM SIGSPATIAL Int. Conf. on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (2015)
